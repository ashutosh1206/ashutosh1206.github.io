&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve developed a new restricted shell. It also allows to manage user access more securely. Let&amp;rsquo;s try it&lt;br>
&lt;code>nc crypto-01.v7frkwrfyhsjtbpfcppnu.ctfz.one 1337&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this post, I will be discussing my solution for USSH-3.0 challenge from CTFZone which I think is the unintended way. The challenge was quite peculiar, involving “blind” exploit as you will see in this write-up. Some parts of the challenge might look like guessing, but if you read this write-up start-to-end, you will see that it was a well-tailored challenge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Locked Dungeons 2 - Swamp CTF</title><link>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/swamp-locked-dungeons-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/swamp-locked-dungeons-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Challenge Points&lt;/strong>: 498&lt;br>

&lt;p>The Dungeon Keeper learned from its mistake. This next lock is protected by even stronger encryption. We’re so close to the final level…there has to be a way in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Dark Dungeon series of crypto challenges were the only ones I enjoyed solving in the CTF. Rest of the crypto challenges were pathetic, involved a lot of guessing and were not really crypto challenges and can be called as puzzles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CBC Bit Flipping Attack</title><link>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/blog/cbc-bit-flipping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/blog/cbc-bit-flipping/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this blog post, the attack on CBC mode of block cipher encryption will be discussed and in the end, detailed writeup for the &lt;a href="https://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/16">16th challenge of Matasano-Crypto-Challenge&lt;/a> i.e. about the Bit Flipping Attack in AES-CBC will be provided with explanation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want the reader to go through these concepts discussed in the following blog posts, before actually understanding how the CBC Bit-Flipping Attack works:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/tree/master/Block-Cipher#mode-detection">Mode Detection Oracle&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We will list down all the information one must have access to, in order to initiate this attack:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
