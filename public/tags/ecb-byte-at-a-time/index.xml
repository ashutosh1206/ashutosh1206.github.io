&lt;p>In this challenge, we are supposed to get the flag which is present in the server.&lt;br>
The server has an input-output program running, which gives AES-ECB encryption of the input given to it. The encryption takes place as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Takes the input from the user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Appends &lt;code>secret&lt;/code> (which is the flag here) to the input&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pads to make it a multiple of blocksize&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Encrypts the resultant string using AES in ECB mode&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gives the ciphertext as the output&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We are only in control of the input to the server. Using the input that we give, we need to get the &lt;code>secret&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
