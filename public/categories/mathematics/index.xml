It is used in both Symmetric and Asymmetric key Cryptography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post gives a basic introduction to Finite Fields and arithmetic operations on it, but I hope the purpose of it is served- to make people, who donâ€™t have basic knowledge about this, understand a few upcoming CTF write-ups, that are based on Finite Fields.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
