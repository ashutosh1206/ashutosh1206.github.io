Challenge Description:
In the halloween party, we want to half a delicious but small cake!
tl;dr
Find Elliptic Curve parameters from given points on the curve Find x-coordinate of 2*P, given y-coordinate of 2*P Invert 2 over mod (P.order()) and multiply the result with 2*P to get P Submit ASIS{P.x} as the flag In case you are new to Elliptic Curves, you can read about them in my library here</description></item><item><title>Crypto writeups - Hack.lu CTF</title><link>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/hacklu18-crypto/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/hacklu18-crypto/</guid><description>Hack.lu CTF is over and we (@teambi0s) finished 13th globally and since we were registered as a local team (thanks to @GeethnaTk) and stood first among the teams registered locally, hence we are eligible for prizes! Yay!
This blog post covers detailed solutions to two of the crypto challenges from Hack.lu CTF 2018- Relations and Multiplayer Part-1. While the former was just about guessing (or detecting the pattern, whatever you want to say) of a black box encryption service, the latter was a more interesting challenge involving Elliptic Curves.</description></item><item><title>Crypto writeups [Part-2] - InCTFi 2018</title><link>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/inctfi18-crypto-part2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ashutosh1206.github.io/ctf/inctfi18-crypto-part2/</guid><description>This blog post covers intended solutions of two crypto challenges from InCTF-2018: Request-Auth and EC-Auth.
Request-Auth Challenge Description
This was a medium level crypto challenge that I created for InCTF International-2018. In the challenge you are given multiple files: iv.txt, key.enc, publickey.pem, ServerSide.py, session.enc and also have a service running these files.
Contents of ServerSide.py:
#!/usr/bin/env python2.7 from Crypto.Cipher import AES from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA from Crypto.Util.number import * from os import urandom import sys BLOCKSIZE = 16 class Unbuffered(object): def __init__(self, stream): self.</description></item></channel></rss>
