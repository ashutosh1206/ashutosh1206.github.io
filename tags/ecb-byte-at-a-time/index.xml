      <description>This challenge was a bit overrated, there were no complications in the challenge, as you will see when we discuss the writeup.
In this challenge, we are supposed to get the flag which is present in the server.
The server has an input-output program running, which gives AES-ECB encryption of the input given to it. The encryption takes place as follows:
Takes the input from the user Appends secret (which is the flag here) to the input Pads to make it a multiple of blocksize Encrypts the resultant string using AES in ECB mode Gives the ciphertext as the output We are only in control of the input to the server.</description>
